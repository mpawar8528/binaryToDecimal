# binaryToDecimal
In this program we had converted a binary number entered by the user into a decimal number.
IN THIS PROGRAM I HAD USED C++ AS MY LANGUAGE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM , I HAD USED 2 WHILE LOOPS
FIRST FOR STORING THE VALUES IN AN ARRAY AND SECOND FOR FINDING THE DECIAML NUMBER.
IT IS AN EASY TO DO PROGRAM .
YOU CAN COMPILE AND RUN IT ON YOUR PC AND LAPTOP EASLY.
